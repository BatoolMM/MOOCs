Raising issues is an essential part of contributing to an open source project. Before you start, it's recommended that you have a basic understanding of Markdown and GitHub, which are commonly used in this workflow. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is used to format and style text on the web. You can find a comprehensive guide to [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) on the GitHub website 

If you're not familiar with GitHub, it's a web-based platform that provides tools for version control, code management, and collaboration. GitHub provides a step-by-step guide to getting started with their platform on their [website](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

It's important to check whether your idea or issue has already been raised by someone else. You can do this by searching through the project's existing issues on GitHub. If you find an issue that is similar to yours, please comment on it to let others know that you're also interested in working on it.

If the issue has already been closed, or if it only partially solves your problem, it's recommended that you open a new issue with a reference to the old one. This can help to keep the discussion organized and ensure that all relevant information is easily accessible.

Remember, raising an issue is an opportunity to improve the project and contribute to the open source community. With a little bit of effort and attention to detail, you can help make a real difference
